* Basic Decription - This repository contains a Health Application which can manage Patients, Doctors, Hospitals, Community, Cities and Encounters.

* Technical Description - In this task I have used java Swing for the front-end of the application. There are total of 15 Java classes within the model package and seven UI classes within the UI package. This repository also contains Ikin package which consist of PNG image for icons. Other than that this application also has five different roles which can perform different task. The first is that of the patient, who may look up doctors and make an appointment. The second role is the Doctor role, which allows one to log in and search for patients as well as add and read patient experiences. Patients may log in and see their encounters. The community administrator role is the third, and it allows users to add, update, and view information about all the hospitals and residences in the community. Another option is to build a hospital or a new house, assign a resident to it, and name it Doctor within Hospital. The fourth option is Hospital admin, which allows users to create new hospitals, browse all hospitals in all communities, and assign specific doctors to hospitals. The final system administrator role allows create, read, update, delete and search operation all 14 classes, including person, patient, doctor, hospital, house, community, city, percent directory, patient, hospital, and doctor directories, as well as vital signs encounters and encounter history. Additionally, I've added login to each of these pages.
